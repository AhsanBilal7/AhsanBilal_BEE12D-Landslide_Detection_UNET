## Abstract

Landslide Detection Using U-Net: A Deep Learning Approach

Landslides pose significant threats to communities and infrastructure, necessitating effective and timely detection methods for early warning systems. This study explores the application of U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture, for landslide detection in satellite imagery. The U-Net model is trained on a labeled dataset of satellite images containing both landslide and non-landslide areas. The network's ability to accurately segment and classify landslide-prone regions is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation processes. Results indicate the effectiveness of the U-Net model in identifying landslide features with high precision and recall rates. The proposed approach showcases the potential of deep learning techniques in automating landslide detection, offering a promising tool for enhancing early warning systems and facilitating timely response to mitigate the impact of landslides on communities and infrastructure.
